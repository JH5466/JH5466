# Welcome to my GitHub

I'm developing my IT skills through structured labs, system configuration exercises, and troubleshooting projects. My goal is to build a clear, practical portfolio that reflects the work I'm doing every day to grow in the field.

More detailed documentation can be found inside each repository, which contains screenshots, notes, and clear explanations of the labs and projects I've completed.
